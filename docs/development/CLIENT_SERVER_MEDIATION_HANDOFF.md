# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-03-11 (compacted active-only handoff)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:
- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**
- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the latest `main`, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document (committed to `main`).
- No moderator involvement in technical decisions, code reviews, or work coordination.

**Handoff management:**
- Put all technical findings, debugging conclusions, and next-step details in this document.
- Assistant (current agent) commits their findings/work and updates the **Active Handoff** section with actionable next steps for the other client.
- Assistant pushes commits to `main`.
- Unexpected untracked content rule (MANDATORY): remove unexpected untracked files/directories before commit; only keep intentional tracked changes for the handoff update.
- Handoff readiness gate (MANDATORY): all executable tests must pass before marking a handoff as ready.
- Environment-gated tests are allowed to be skipped, but must be explicitly identified as gated with the required environment/runtime prerequisites documented in the handoff.
- Runtime verification gate (MANDATORY): before declaring a server-side blocker fixed, verify the running service is on current binaries (not stale publish output) and document the verification command/output in handoff notes.
- OAuth contract check (MANDATORY when auth is involved): verify `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and requested scopes exactly match server-registered OpenIddict client permissions before requesting cross-machine retries.
- Secret handling rule (MANDATORY): never commit raw bearer tokens/refresh tokens; share token acquisition steps and sanitized outputs only.
- Moderator relays a short "check for updates" message to the other machine.
- Other agent pulls latest, reads the handoff, and takes action without asking questions.

**Document maintenance:**
- Pre-commit archive rule (MANDATORY): before committing this file, move all completed/older handoff tasks to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Keep only the single current task in **Active Handoff** (one active block only).
- If a task is completed, archive it first, then replace **Active Handoff** with the next task.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Current Status

- Issues #1-#45 and previous sprint/batch closeout work: complete.
- Phase 2.10 Android contract alignment: complete (archived).
- Phase 2.12 Chat Testing Infrastructure: complete (integration tests added).
- This handoff was compacted on 2026-03-11 to remove completed historical sections from active view.

## Environment

| Role | Machine | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Server | `mint22` | `https://mint22:15443/` |
| Client | `Windows11-TestDNC` | Sync dir: `C:\Users\benk\Documents\synctray` |

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: OpenIddict bearer on files/sync endpoints via `FilesControllerBase` `[Authorize]`.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.

## Active Handoff

### Phase 2.13 IN PROGRESS — Documentation

**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Owner:** Server agent (in progress)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS 🔄

**What was completed:**
- Chat module docs: `docs/modules/chat/` — README, API reference (all ~30 REST endpoints), ARCHITECTURE (data model, service layer, gRPC), REALTIME (SignalR hub methods and events), PUSH (FCM/UnifiedPush pipeline and configuration).
- Android app docs: `docs/clients/android/README.md` — overview, build instructions, build flavors, OAuth flow, architecture, dependencies.
- XML docs: all chat module public types already documented; added XML docs to Android platform boilerplate types (MainActivity, MainApplication, AppDelegate, Program).
- Fixed Phase 2.3 summary table discrepancy (was showing 3/7 completed, actually all 7 completed).

**Remaining Phase 2.13 items:**
- `src/Modules/Chat/DotNetCloud.Modules.Chat/README.md` — per-project developer README
- `docs/clients/android/SETUP.md` — development environment setup guide
- `docs/clients/android/DISTRIBUTION.md` — store listing and F-Droid metadata guide
- Per-project root READMEs for Chat.Data and Chat.Host

**Next action:**
- Continue Phase 2.13 remaining docs, or proceed to other in-progress phases (2.8 remaining UI components, 2.10 Android app features).
- Phase 2.10 Android app work is client-side (Windows machine).
