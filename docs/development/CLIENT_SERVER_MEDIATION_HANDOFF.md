# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-06-23 17:11 UTC (Windows11-TestDNC: large file upload blocked by 429 rate limiting — handoff to server)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.
- VFS Phase 3 (Windows Cloud Filter API) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (2026-05-12).
- VFS Phase 2 (core abstraction layer) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (previously).

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `main`
- No moderator involvement in technical decisions, code reviews, or work coordination.

**Role separation (MANDATORY):**

- **Client code** (`src/Clients/`, `src/UI/`) is handled ONLY by client machines (`mint-OptiPlex-7010`, `Windows11-TestDNC`, `mint-dnc-client`, `monolith`).
- **Server code** (`src/Core/`, `src/Modules/`) is handled ONLY by server machines (`cloud.kimball.home`, `mint22`).
- Each agent ONLY executes actions in the block matching their machine name (from the Environment table).
- If no action block matches your machine, the handoff is not for you — relay it to the moderator.
- Never cross role boundaries: a client agent never deploys server code, a server agent never builds client apps.

**Active Handoff format (MANDATORY):**

Every Active Handoff MUST use per-machine action blocks. Actions are grouped by the machine that executes them, using the exact machine names from the Environment table.

```markdown
### Active Handoff

**Summary:** [one-line description of what's happening]

[Context/background — what changed, why, relevant commits]

---

### Server Actions — `cloud.kimball.home`

- [ ] Action 1 with exact commands
- [ ] Action 2

### Client Actions — `mint-OptiPlex-7010`

- [ ] Action 1 with exact commands
- [ ] Action 2
```

**Critical rules:**
- Each agent ONLY executes actions in the block matching their machine name (from the Environment table).
- If no action block matches your machine, the handoff is not for you — relay it to the moderator.
- Always include exact commands (ready to copy-paste).
- Mark blocks with `✓` when complete; update status inline.
- One handoff may have 1 or 2 action blocks depending on workflow stage.

**Handoff management:**

- Put all technical findings, debugging conclusions, and next-step details in this document.
- Assistant (current agent) commits their findings/work and updates the **Active Handoff** section with actionable next steps for the other client.
- Assistant pushes commits to `main`.
- Unexpected untracked content rule (MANDATORY): remove unexpected untracked files/directories before commit; only keep intentional tracked changes for the handoff update.
- Handoff readiness gate (MANDATORY): all executable tests must pass before marking a handoff as ready.
- Environment-gated tests are allowed to be skipped, but must be explicitly identified as gated with the required environment/runtime prerequisites documented in the handoff.
- Runtime verification gate (MANDATORY): before declaring a server-side blocker fixed, verify the running service is on current binaries (not stale publish output) and document the verification command/output in handoff notes.
- OAuth contract check (MANDATORY when auth is involved): verify `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and requested scopes exactly match server-registered OpenIddict client permissions before requesting cross-machine retries.
- Secret handling rule (MANDATORY): never commit raw bearer tokens/refresh tokens; share token acquisition steps and sanitized outputs only.
- Moderator relays a short "check for updates" message to the other machine.
- Moderator handoff prompt rule (MANDATORY): every ready-to-relay message must explicitly state the target machine name (for example: `cloud.kimball.home`, `mint-dnc-client`, `Windows11-TestDNC`).
- Other agent pulls latest, reads the handoff, and takes action without asking questions.

**Document maintenance:**

- Pre-commit archive rule (MANDATORY): before committing this file, move all completed/older handoff tasks to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Keep only the single current task in **Active Handoff** (one active block only).
- If a task is completed, archive it first, then replace **Active Handoff** with the next task.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Current Status

- YARP auth header doubling fix: deployed, verified server-side (`cloud.kimball.home`), verified client-side (`Windows11-TestDNC`) — 401 resolved.
- X-Device-Id header duplication fix: deployed on `cloud.kimball.home` (commit `d1dd3746`). Service restarted, all 14 modules healthy.
- X-Device-Id fix verified on `Windows11-TestDNC`: SyncTray connects to `cloud.dotnetcloud.net` successfully, no 401/502 errors, no X-Device-Id warnings. (Archived.)
- Large file upload 429 rate limiting: **root cause found and fixed** on `cloud.kimball.home` (commit `73babfe5`). Core.Server's default auth scheme only handled cookies — Bearer token requests were anonymous, falling to IP-based 100 req/60s global limit. Added policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Policy`) forwarding Bearer tokens to OpenIddict validation. Verified with diagnostic logging.
- All prior Phase 2, chat, pre-Linux sync remediation, SyncTray icon enhancement work is complete and archived.
- VFS Phase 1 (server-side prerequisites) complete on `cloud.kimball.home`.
- VFS Phase 2 (core abstraction layer) complete on `Windows11-TestDNC`.
- VFS Phase 3 (Windows Cloud Filter API) complete on `Windows11-TestDNC`.
- VFS Phase 4 (Linux FUSE) complete on `mint-dnc-client`.
- VFS Phase 5 (SyncTray UI Integration) complete on `Windows11-TestDNC` (archived).
- VFS Phase 6 (Testing & Validation) complete on `Windows11-TestDNC`.

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatRealtimeService.ChannelGroup()` and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.

## Active Handoff

**Summary:** ✅ 429 rate limit root cause found and fixed on `cloud.kimball.home` (commit `73babfe5`). Needs client verification on `Windows11-TestDNC`.

**Root cause:** Core.Server's `UseAuthentication()` only handled cookie auth (`Identity.Application` scheme, the default from `AddIdentity()`). Bearer token requests from SyncTray appeared as anonymous — `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` was registered but not part of the default authenticate scheme. The global rate limiter then used IP-based partitioning (100 req/60s), not per-user (10,000 req/60s). At ~1 chunk/sec + sync tree + reconcile calls, 100 req/min was easily exceeded → 429s.

**Fix (commit `73babfe5`):** Added `DotNetCloud.Policy` scheme in `AuthServiceExtensions.cs` that forwards Bearer token requests to `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` and cookie requests to `Identity.Application`. Set as `DefaultAuthenticateScheme` so `UseAuthentication()` and the rate limiter correctly identify authenticated Bearer token users.

**Deploy status:** ✅ Deployed to `cloud.kimball.home`. All 14 modules healthy. Diagnostic logging (Debug level) confirms forwarding works.

### Client Actions — `Windows11-TestDNC`

- [ ] `git pull` on `perf/synctray-scan-and-transfer-speedups`
- [ ] Build SyncTray: `dotnet build src\Clients\DotNetCloud.Client.SyncTray\DotNetCloud.Client.SyncTray.csproj -c Release`
- [ ] Upload a large file (1+ GB) and confirm:
  - No 429 errors during chunk upload
  - Upload completes successfully
  - File appears correctly on server (web UI or API)
- [ ] Check server logs for clean rate limiter partition: `sudo journalctl -u dotnetcloud --since "10 min ago" | grep "RateLimitingDiagnostic"` should show `IsAuth=True, HasSub=True` for upload requests
- [ ] Verify subsequent sync passes show `0 queued` (no re-upload loops)
