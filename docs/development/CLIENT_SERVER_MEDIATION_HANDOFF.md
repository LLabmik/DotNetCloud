# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-01 (AI request queueing on `feature/ai-queuing` deployed + server-side verified on cloud.kimball.home; browser/token UI checks pending for user)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `feature/ai-queuing`

## Archived Handoff — SyncTray test machine: DB Outage SyncTray Simulation (plan §11.4) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-24, client agent — `Windows11-DNC`)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.4 (SyncTray simulation)

### Client pre-requisite (done)
- SyncTray **0.4.07** rebuilt from HEAD (`cbddab37`) and installed to `C:\Program Files\DotNetCloud\DesktopClient\SyncTray` (updater 0.4.07 too; old 0.4.02 backed up to `SyncTray.bak-0.4.02`).
- Server verified Healthy before outage: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- SyncTray running, 1 account, token valid, sync idle (0 changes) → tray green.

### Outage phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server confirmed down: `cloud.dotnetcloud.net:443` connection refused.
- ✅ **Tray → gray** within one backoff interval: `10:04:40 WRN Server unreachable while syncing context` → `SyncEngine` sets `SyncState.Offline` → tray `TrayState.Offline` (gray); tooltip "DotNetCloud Sync — server unreachable, retrying automatically".
- ✅ **Automatic retry/backoff**: SSE reconnects 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (attempts 1–8), then holds at 60s.
- ✅ **"Sync now" fast-fail**: connection-refused fails fast; `TimeoutHandler` caps requests at 30s; sync pass observed failing in ~12s. No hang.

### Recovery phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server recovered: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- ✅ **Automatic recovery, no manual restart**: failing sync passes at 10:07:25/10:07:45 (server still down) → successful pass at 10:08:04 (`Sync pass complete, RemoteChanges=0, LocalQueued=0, LocalApplied=0`) → `SyncState.Idle`.
- ✅ SSE reconnected automatically at **10:08:52** (within the 60s backoff cap).
- ✅ Tray returned to **green/idle** (visually confirmed by moderator).

**Result: PASS** — no client regressions observed. Evidence in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DotNetCloud\logs\sync-tray20260824.log`.

## Archived Handoff — Android test machine: DB Outage Android Simulation (plan §11.5) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-24, client agent — `monolith`)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.5 (Android simulation)
**Prerequisite (DONE — server agent):** Server deploy verified on `cloud.kimball.home` (`https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`): resilience code live, `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules. §11.2/§11.3 + integration tests passed. SyncTray client simulation §11.4 → PASS (archived above).

### Client pre-requisite (done)
- Android **0.4.07** rebuilt from HEAD (`8bdc1f57`) arm64-debug and installed to physical phone (Samsung S24 Ultra, `R5CWC356B2K`). Logged in to `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`, SignalR connected, channels loaded.
- Server verified Healthy before outage: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.

### Outage phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server confirmed down: `cloud.dotnetcloud.net:443` connection refused.
- ✅ **Global red banner appeared** ("Can't reach server — showing cached data. Changes will be queued.") over the channel list.
- ✅ **Chat showed cached messages** (Test 6/7/8, Aug 5 "Posting remotely" msg, etc.) with the banner still visible.
- ✅ **Sending a message queued it**: `OFFLINE_QUEUE_TEST_1301` appeared in the list with "just now" + the "Message queued — will send when you're back online." banner.

### Recovery phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server recovered: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- ✅ **Banner cleared automatically** (≤ ~20 s probe interval; confirmed via UI dump — banner gone).
- ✅ **Queued message flushed**: `GetMessagesAsync` fetched `OFFLINE_QUEUE_TEST_1301` from the server; message shows as sent ("1m ago", no queued indicator).
- ✅ SignalR reconnected automatically (`JoinChannelGroupAsync` joined `chat-channel-…`).

### Client bugs found & fixed during the sim (committed on this branch)
1. **Android receiver/service `Name` bug → cold-start crash.** `CalendarBootReceiver`, `CalendarAlarmReceiver`, `FcmMessagingService`, `UnifiedPushReceiver` were declared both manually in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`.X` → `net.dotnetcloud.client.X`) and via `[BroadcastReceiver]`/`[Service]` attributes without explicit `Name`, so the generated Java class landed in a `crc…` package → `ClassNotFoundException` when Android instantiated it (the sticky `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast crashed every cold start). Fixed by adding `Name = "net.dotnetcloud.client.X"` to the attributes (mirrors the working `[Service(Name=…)]` pattern).
2. **Phase E banner overlay crashed launch.** Wrapping the `Shell` in a `Grid` violates MAUI's "Parent of a Page must also be a Page". Replaced with a native Android platform overlay on `Android.Resource.Id.Content` driven by `ConnectivityViewModel`, offset below the status bar (`ResolveStatusBarHeight`). Old `ConnectivityBannerView.xaml` deleted.

**Result: PASS** — no client regressions. Evidence: `dnc-banner-visible.png`, `dnc-message-queued.png`, `dnc-recovered.png` (on monolith), UI-dump text nodes, and logcat (`adb logcat`).

## Archived Handoff — Android AI tab Phases B–F + E2E verification (2026-08-29) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-29, client agent — `monolith`; server agent — `cloud.kimball.home`)
**Branch:** `feature/android-ai-tab`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/ANDROID_AI_TAB_PLAN.md`
Android AI tab implemented; server-side REST/Bearer 500 fixed + deployed; full E2E verified on-device (Samsung R5CWC356B2K). Full detail in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Archived Handoff — AI request queueing: deploy to cloud.kimball.home ✅

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-09-01, server agent — `cloud.kimball.home`)
**Branch:** `feature/ai-queuing` (deployed HEAD `846e3b17`)
**Canonical plan:** `docs/AI_REQUEST_QUEUEING_PLAN.md`
**From:** client agent (`monolith`), 2026-09-01

### Result (server-side verified on cloud.kimball.home)

- Deployed via `scripts/deploy.sh` (full build, all 15 targets). `dotnetcloud.ai.dll` + `DotNetCloud.Modules.AI.Data.dll` + AI RCL hash-verified in all 3 deploy locations.
- `/health/ready` **Healthy**; **14/14 modules** Running (incl. `dotnetcloud.ai`); `blazor.web.js` 200 (no static-asset regression).
- `dotnet test tests/DotNetCloud.Modules.AI.Tests/` → **35/35 passed** (incl. `AiCompletionQueue`).
- `GET /api/v1/ai/settings` → **401** without token (route live, `[Authorize]`).
- DB-backed settings confirmed in `dbo.SystemSettings`: `DefaultModel=gemma4:12b`, `Provider=ollama`, `ApiBaseUrl=http://monolith.kimball.home:11434/`.
- Ollama on `monolith.kimball.home:11434` reachable and serving `gemma4:12b` (matches DB).
- ⚠️ Token-authenticated settings response + Blazor "Generating…"/queue-position UI checks require a real user session (server agent cannot obtain a token without a password) — **left for user/browser verification** (see Active Handoff).

## Active Handoff

### User verification: AI request queueing on cloud (browser, `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`)

**Status:** pending (user/moderator login)
**Branch:** `feature/ai-queuing` (deployed, commit `846e3b17`)

- Blazor AI chat: model shown as static text (`gemma4:12b`, no picker); send a message → **"Generating…"** (NOT "Loading model into memory") → streamed tokens.
- Two concurrent requests (Blazor + Android) → second shows **"In queue: position 2 of 2"** then streams; Ollama receives requests one at a time.
- `GET /api/v1/ai/settings` with a valid token → `defaultModel` = `gemma4:12b`.
- Note: Ollama runs on `monolith.kimball.home:11434` (client machine). If monolith is offline, AI chat shows the Ollama-unhealthy banner — expected, not a server bug.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- ✅ **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatHub.ChannelGroup()`, `CoreHub.JoinGroupAsync()`, and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.
- ✅ **Calendar event broadcasting pattern:** Follow `CalendarReminderEventHandler` (`CalendarReminderEventSubscriber` + `CalendarEventBroadcastHandler`) as the reference implementation. It calls `CoreCapabilitiesClient.BroadcastRealtimeEventAsync` for SignalR and `SendNotificationAsync` for FCM push.
- ✅ **DM notification flow:** `DmChannelCreatedEventHandler` subscribes to `ChannelCreatedEvent`. For `DirectMessage` channels only, it sends push via `IPushNotificationService` and raises `IChatMessageNotifier.DmChannelCreated` for in-process Blazor. `GlobalChatNotificationState` handles the Blazor-side toast. Android handles the push-side with 3 inline notification actions.
