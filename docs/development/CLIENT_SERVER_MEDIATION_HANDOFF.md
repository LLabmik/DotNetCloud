# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-07 (Server DM name resolution deployed — verify Android)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `fix/chat-dm-notification`

## Active Handoff — Monolith: Verify Android DM display names after server-side resolution

**Summary:** Server now resolves DM channel names to display names in `ChannelService.ListChannelsAsync` (deployed to cloud, commit `260c17fd`). No Android code changes needed — the API response now returns display names instead of `DM-{guid}-{guid}`. Verify Android client shows correct DM names.

**Steps:**
1. `git pull` on `fix/chat-dm-notification` branch
2. Build and deploy Android app to emulator/device
3. Open Chat → verify DM channels show display names (not `DM-{guid}-{guid}`)
4. Send a DM → verify push notification arrives with correct display name
5. Verify the 3 inline notification actions (reply, mark read, dismiss) still work

**Expected:** All DM channels show the other user's display name. If `IUserDirectory` isn't resolving, fallback shows 8-char user ID prefix.

**Server log check (optional):**
```bash
# On cloud: confirm resolution is working
sudo journalctl -u dotnetcloud --no-pager | grep ResolveDmChannelNames
```

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Environment

| Role           | Machine              | Detail                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server         | `cloud.kimball.home` | `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/` (production)                                      |
| Server         | `mint22`             | `https://mint22:5443/` (dev)                                                       |
| Client         | `Windows11-TestDNC`  | Sync dir: `C:\Users\benk\synctray`                                       |
| Client         | `mint-dnc-client`    | Linux Mint 22 validation host for desktop sync client implementation + E2E testing |
| Client         | `mint-OptiPlex-7010` | production client connected to `cloud.dotnetcloud.net`              |
| Android Client | `monolith`           | Android MAUI app development + emulator testing (Windows 11)                       |

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- ✅ **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatHub.ChannelGroup()`, `CoreHub.JoinGroupAsync()`, and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.
- ✅ **Calendar event broadcasting pattern:** Follow `CalendarReminderEventHandler` (`CalendarReminderEventSubscriber` + `CalendarEventBroadcastHandler`) as the reference implementation. It calls `CoreCapabilitiesClient.BroadcastRealtimeEventAsync` for SignalR and `SendNotificationAsync` for FCM push.
- ✅ **DM notification flow:** `DmChannelCreatedEventHandler` subscribes to `ChannelCreatedEvent`. For `DirectMessage` channels only, it sends push via `IPushNotificationService` and raises `IChatMessageNotifier.DmChannelCreated` for in-process Blazor. `GlobalChatNotificationState` handles the Blazor-side toast. Android handles the push-side with 3 inline notification actions.
