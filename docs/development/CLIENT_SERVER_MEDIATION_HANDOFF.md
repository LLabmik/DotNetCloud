# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-24 (SyncTray DB Outage simulation §11.4 archived ✅ PASS; new Active Handoff → Android §11.5 on monolith)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`

## Archived Handoff — SyncTray test machine: DB Outage SyncTray Simulation (plan §11.4) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-24, client agent — `Windows11-DNC`)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.4 (SyncTray simulation)

### Client pre-requisite (done)
- SyncTray **0.4.07** rebuilt from HEAD (`cbddab37`) and installed to `C:\Program Files\DotNetCloud\DesktopClient\SyncTray` (updater 0.4.07 too; old 0.4.02 backed up to `SyncTray.bak-0.4.02`).
- Server verified Healthy before outage: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- SyncTray running, 1 account, token valid, sync idle (0 changes) → tray green.

### Outage phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server confirmed down: `cloud.dotnetcloud.net:443` connection refused.
- ✅ **Tray → gray** within one backoff interval: `10:04:40 WRN Server unreachable while syncing context` → `SyncEngine` sets `SyncState.Offline` → tray `TrayState.Offline` (gray); tooltip "DotNetCloud Sync — server unreachable, retrying automatically".
- ✅ **Automatic retry/backoff**: SSE reconnects 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (attempts 1–8), then holds at 60s.
- ✅ **"Sync now" fast-fail**: connection-refused fails fast; `TimeoutHandler` caps requests at 30s; sync pass observed failing in ~12s. No hang.

### Recovery phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server recovered: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- ✅ **Automatic recovery, no manual restart**: failing sync passes at 10:07:25/10:07:45 (server still down) → successful pass at 10:08:04 (`Sync pass complete, RemoteChanges=0, LocalQueued=0, LocalApplied=0`) → `SyncState.Idle`.
- ✅ SSE reconnected automatically at **10:08:52** (within the 60s backoff cap).
- ✅ Tray returned to **green/idle** (visually confirmed by moderator).

**Result: PASS** — no client regressions observed. Evidence in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DotNetCloud\logs\sync-tray20260824.log`.

## Active Handoff — Android: DB Outage Android Simulation (plan §11.5)

**Target:** `monolith` (Android MAUI app dev + emulator testing, Windows 11)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.5 (Android simulation)
**Prerequisite (DONE — server agent):** Server deploy verified on `cloud.kimball.home` (`https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`): resilience code live, `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules. §11.2/§11.3 + integration tests passed. SyncTray client simulation §11.4 → PASS (archived above).

**Task:** Run the Android outage simulation (§11.5) against the live production server:

1. Deploy a debug arm64 build (see repo memory for exact adb/build commands).
2. Server outage — ask the moderator to **stop the DotNetCloud service** on `cloud` (`sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`; keep device internet on). The Android agent cannot stop production itself; the moderator executes it on request.
3. Assert:
   - The global red banner appears.
   - Opening chat shows cached messages.
   - Sending a message queues it (existing "queued" banner).
4. Server recovery — ask the moderator to **start the service** (`sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`; wait until `/health/ready` is Healthy again — 14/14 modules, `database` Healthy).
5. Assert: the banner clears automatically (≤ ~20 s) and queued messages flush.

**Report back:** pass/fail + evidence (banner screenshots with timestamps, queue flush timings) here.

**Notes for the Android agent:**
- Production server is `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`. App must be logged in to an active account before starting the sim.
- During the outage the app's `ServerReachabilityService` + `ConnectivityViewModel` should show the global red banner and the offline queue should hold messages. Do NOT close the handoff until the recovery assertion (step 5) passes.
- If the banner does NOT appear, chat does NOT show cached messages, or queued messages do NOT flush after recovery, report it as a client regression with logs.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- ✅ **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatHub.ChannelGroup()`, `CoreHub.JoinGroupAsync()`, and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.
- ✅ **Calendar event broadcasting pattern:** Follow `CalendarReminderEventHandler` (`CalendarReminderEventSubscriber` + `CalendarEventBroadcastHandler`) as the reference implementation. It calls `CoreCapabilitiesClient.BroadcastRealtimeEventAsync` for SignalR and `SendNotificationAsync` for FCM push.
- ✅ **DM notification flow:** `DmChannelCreatedEventHandler` subscribes to `ChannelCreatedEvent`. For `DirectMessage` channels only, it sends push via `IPushNotificationService` and raises `IChatMessageNotifier.DmChannelCreated` for in-process Blazor. `GlobalChatNotificationState` handles the Blazor-side toast. Android handles the push-side with 3 inline notification actions.
