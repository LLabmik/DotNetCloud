# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-29 (Server Phase A handoff completed + archived; new Active Handoff: client verify AI REST API end-to-end + Android AI tab Phases B–F)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `feature/android-ai-tab`

## Archived Handoff — SyncTray test machine: DB Outage SyncTray Simulation (plan §11.4) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-24, client agent — `Windows11-DNC`)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.4 (SyncTray simulation)

### Client pre-requisite (done)
- SyncTray **0.4.07** rebuilt from HEAD (`cbddab37`) and installed to `C:\Program Files\DotNetCloud\DesktopClient\SyncTray` (updater 0.4.07 too; old 0.4.02 backed up to `SyncTray.bak-0.4.02`).
- Server verified Healthy before outage: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- SyncTray running, 1 account, token valid, sync idle (0 changes) → tray green.

### Outage phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server confirmed down: `cloud.dotnetcloud.net:443` connection refused.
- ✅ **Tray → gray** within one backoff interval: `10:04:40 WRN Server unreachable while syncing context` → `SyncEngine` sets `SyncState.Offline` → tray `TrayState.Offline` (gray); tooltip "DotNetCloud Sync — server unreachable, retrying automatically".
- ✅ **Automatic retry/backoff**: SSE reconnects 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s (attempts 1–8), then holds at 60s.
- ✅ **"Sync now" fast-fail**: connection-refused fails fast; `TimeoutHandler` caps requests at 30s; sync pass observed failing in ~12s. No hang.

### Recovery phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server recovered: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- ✅ **Automatic recovery, no manual restart**: failing sync passes at 10:07:25/10:07:45 (server still down) → successful pass at 10:08:04 (`Sync pass complete, RemoteChanges=0, LocalQueued=0, LocalApplied=0`) → `SyncState.Idle`.
- ✅ SSE reconnected automatically at **10:08:52** (within the 60s backoff cap).
- ✅ Tray returned to **green/idle** (visually confirmed by moderator).

**Result: PASS** — no client regressions observed. Evidence in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DotNetCloud\logs\sync-tray20260824.log`.

## Archived Handoff — Android test machine: DB Outage Android Simulation (plan §11.5) ✅ PASS

**Status:** completed ✅ (2026-08-24, client agent — `monolith`)
**Branch:** `fix/database-offline-recovery`
**Canonical plan:** `docs/DB_OUTAGE_RESILIENCE_PLAN.md` §11.5 (Android simulation)
**Prerequisite (DONE — server agent):** Server deploy verified on `cloud.kimball.home` (`https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`): resilience code live, `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules. §11.2/§11.3 + integration tests passed. SyncTray client simulation §11.4 → PASS (archived above).

### Client pre-requisite (done)
- Android **0.4.07** rebuilt from HEAD (`8bdc1f57`) arm64-debug and installed to physical phone (Samsung S24 Ultra, `R5CWC356B2K`). Logged in to `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`, SignalR connected, channels loaded.
- Server verified Healthy before outage: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.

### Outage phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl stop dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server confirmed down: `cloud.dotnetcloud.net:443` connection refused.
- ✅ **Global red banner appeared** ("Can't reach server — showing cached data. Changes will be queued.") over the channel list.
- ✅ **Chat showed cached messages** (Test 6/7/8, Aug 5 "Posting remotely" msg, etc.) with the banner still visible.
- ✅ **Sending a message queued it**: `OFFLINE_QUEUE_TEST_1301` appeared in the list with "just now" + the "Message queued — will send when you're back online." banner.

### Recovery phase (moderator: `sudo systemctl start dotnetcloud`)
- ✅ Server recovered: `/health/ready` Healthy, `database` Healthy, 14/14 modules.
- ✅ **Banner cleared automatically** (≤ ~20 s probe interval; confirmed via UI dump — banner gone).
- ✅ **Queued message flushed**: `GetMessagesAsync` fetched `OFFLINE_QUEUE_TEST_1301` from the server; message shows as sent ("1m ago", no queued indicator).
- ✅ SignalR reconnected automatically (`JoinChannelGroupAsync` joined `chat-channel-…`).

### Client bugs found & fixed during the sim (committed on this branch)
1. **Android receiver/service `Name` bug → cold-start crash.** `CalendarBootReceiver`, `CalendarAlarmReceiver`, `FcmMessagingService`, `UnifiedPushReceiver` were declared both manually in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`.X` → `net.dotnetcloud.client.X`) and via `[BroadcastReceiver]`/`[Service]` attributes without explicit `Name`, so the generated Java class landed in a `crc…` package → `ClassNotFoundException` when Android instantiated it (the sticky `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast crashed every cold start). Fixed by adding `Name = "net.dotnetcloud.client.X"` to the attributes (mirrors the working `[Service(Name=…)]` pattern).
2. **Phase E banner overlay crashed launch.** Wrapping the `Shell` in a `Grid` violates MAUI's "Parent of a Page must also be a Page". Replaced with a native Android platform overlay on `Android.Resource.Id.Content` driven by `ConnectivityViewModel`, offset below the status bar (`ResolveStatusBarHeight`). Old `ConnectivityBannerView.xaml` deleted.

**Result: PASS** — no client regressions. Evidence: `dnc-banner-visible.png`, `dnc-message-queued.png`, `dnc-recovered.png` (on monolith), UI-dump text nodes, and logcat (`adb logcat`).

## Active Handoff

### Client: verify the AI REST API end-to-end + proceed with the Android AI tab (Phases B–F)

**Status:** pending (client agent — `monolith`)
**Branch:** `feature/android-ai-tab`
**From:** server agent (`cloud.kimball.home`), 2026-08-29
**Priority:** required — the Phase A server work (AI REST API for the Android AI tab) is implemented + deployed; Phases B–F depend on the authenticated verification below.
**Canonical plan:** `docs/ANDROID_AI_TAB_PLAN.md` (Phase A server work DONE; proceed with Phases B–F).
**Target:** Android client dev on `monolith`, server `cloud.kimball.home` (`https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`).

**Phase A server work — DONE (archived):** the AI REST proxy route, AI host auth (Bearer introspection + cookie policy scheme), and rename endpoint are implemented and deployed to cloud.kimball.home. Full detail archived to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md` ("Server — AI module REST API for the Android AI tab"). Server-verified: `/api/v1/ai/*` is proxied and returns **401 without a token**; AI module Running + Healthy (14/14).

**Remaining verification (could not be done on the server — closed-system mode, no test-account credentials, Ollama on `monolith` unreachable from cloud):** with the AI module installed and Ollama reachable, confirm against `https://cloud.dotnetcloud.net/`:
- `GET /api/v1/ai/models` → **200** with a valid Bearer token, **401** without.
- Per-user round-trip: create → send (stream) → list → rename → delete is isolated per user.
- `GET /api/v1/ai/health/ollama` → **200** when healthy / **503** when not (Ollama configured at `http://monolith.kimball.home:11434`).

**Then proceed with Phases B–F** of `docs/ANDROID_AI_TAB_PLAN.md`. API base: `/api/v1/ai/` (proxied by Core.Server, excluded from the response envelope; auth = Bearer introspection or cookie).

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- ✅ **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatHub.ChannelGroup()`, `CoreHub.JoinGroupAsync()`, and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.
- ✅ **Calendar event broadcasting pattern:** Follow `CalendarReminderEventHandler` (`CalendarReminderEventSubscriber` + `CalendarEventBroadcastHandler`) as the reference implementation. It calls `CoreCapabilitiesClient.BroadcastRealtimeEventAsync` for SignalR and `SendNotificationAsync` for FCM push.
- ✅ **DM notification flow:** `DmChannelCreatedEventHandler` subscribes to `ChannelCreatedEvent`. For `DirectMessage` channels only, it sends push via `IPushNotificationService` and raises `IChatMessageNotifier.DmChannelCreated` for in-process Blazor. `GlobalChatNotificationState` handles the Blazor-side toast. Android handles the push-side with 3 inline notification actions.
