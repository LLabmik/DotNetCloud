# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-06-23 15:15 UTC (429 rate limiting — needs server investigation)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.
- VFS Phase 3 (Windows Cloud Filter API) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (2026-05-12).
- VFS Phase 2 (core abstraction layer) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (previously).

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the branch specified in the relay message, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document.
- **Current active branch:** `main`
- No moderator involvement in technical decisions, code reviews, or work coordination.

**Role separation (MANDATORY):**

- **Client code** (`src/Clients/`, `src/UI/`) is handled ONLY by client machines (`mint-OptiPlex-7010`, `Windows11-TestDNC`, `mint-dnc-client`, `monolith`).
- **Server code** (`src/Core/`, `src/Modules/`) is handled ONLY by server machines (`cloud.kimball.home`, `mint22`).
- Each agent ONLY executes actions in the block matching their machine name (from the Environment table).
- If no action block matches your machine, the handoff is not for you — relay it to the moderator.
- Never cross role boundaries: a client agent never deploys server code, a server agent never builds client apps.

**Active Handoff format (MANDATORY):**

Every Active Handoff MUST use per-machine action blocks. Actions are grouped by the machine that executes them, using the exact machine names from the Environment table.

```markdown
### Active Handoff

**Summary:** [one-line description of what's happening]

[Context/background — what changed, why, relevant commits]

---

### Server Actions — `cloud.kimball.home`

- [ ] Action 1 with exact commands
- [ ] Action 2

### Client Actions — `mint-OptiPlex-7010`

- [ ] Action 1 with exact commands
- [ ] Action 2
```

**Critical rules:**
- Each agent ONLY executes actions in the block matching their machine name (from the Environment table).
- If no action block matches your machine, the handoff is not for you — relay it to the moderator.
- Always include exact commands (ready to copy-paste).
- Mark blocks with `✓` when complete; update status inline.
- One handoff may have 1 or 2 action blocks depending on workflow stage.

**Handoff management:**

- Put all technical findings, debugging conclusions, and next-step details in this document.
- Assistant (current agent) commits their findings/work and updates the **Active Handoff** section with actionable next steps for the other client.
- Assistant pushes commits to `main`.
- Unexpected untracked content rule (MANDATORY): remove unexpected untracked files/directories before commit; only keep intentional tracked changes for the handoff update.
- Handoff readiness gate (MANDATORY): all executable tests must pass before marking a handoff as ready.
- Environment-gated tests are allowed to be skipped, but must be explicitly identified as gated with the required environment/runtime prerequisites documented in the handoff.
- Runtime verification gate (MANDATORY): before declaring a server-side blocker fixed, verify the running service is on current binaries (not stale publish output) and document the verification command/output in handoff notes.
- OAuth contract check (MANDATORY when auth is involved): verify `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and requested scopes exactly match server-registered OpenIddict client permissions before requesting cross-machine retries.
- Secret handling rule (MANDATORY): never commit raw bearer tokens/refresh tokens; share token acquisition steps and sanitized outputs only.
- Moderator relays a short "check for updates" message to the other machine.
- Moderator handoff prompt rule (MANDATORY): every ready-to-relay message must explicitly state the target machine name (for example: `cloud.kimball.home`, `mint-dnc-client`, `Windows11-TestDNC`).
- Other agent pulls latest, reads the handoff, and takes action without asking questions.

**Document maintenance:**

- Pre-commit archive rule (MANDATORY): before committing this file, move all completed/older handoff tasks to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Keep only the single current task in **Active Handoff** (one active block only).
- If a task is completed, archive it first, then replace **Active Handoff** with the next task.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (JWT Bearer) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]`. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatRealtimeService.ChannelGroup()` and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.

## Active Handoff

**Summary:** 🔴 Chunk uploads hit 429 (Too Many Requests) during initial sync — rate limiting configuration needs server-side investigation.

**Context:** After the 502 fix was verified, the client also hits 429 errors during chunk upload sync. During a single sync pass, ~252 chunk upload requests for a 1.17GB file triggered 429 responses from the server after ~32 seconds of activity.

**Client-side findings (mint-OptiPlex-7010):**
- 429 errors start after ~32 seconds of chunk upload activity
- Most chunks return 409 (content-addressable dedup — already on server)
- Even 409s count against rate limits (middleware runs before controller)
- `MaxConcurrency` is 8 parallel uploads
- Token is valid + refreshed — auth is fine
- `X-Device-Id` header is being sent (per-device partitioning)
- Client-side fix applied: 429 now retried with backoff alongside 5xx (but this is a band-aid — sync should not be rate-limited at all)

**Server-side rate limiting config (from `appsettings.json`):**
```json
"GlobalPermitLimit": 100,        // anonymous: 100 req/60s
"AuthenticatedPermitLimit": 10000, // authenticated: 10,000 req/60s
"upload-chunks": { "PermitLimit": 1200, "WindowSeconds": 60, "PerDevice": true }
```

**Hypothesis:** Rates should be sufficient for 252 chunks over 32s, suggesting the bottleneck may be:
1. An infrastructure-level rate limiter (Cloudflare, nginx reverse proxy) on `cloud.dotnetcloud.net`
2. The global limiter (not per-device) exhausting the shared 10,000/60s bucket across all routes including SSE, tree, changes, etc.
3. The `upload-chunks` module limiter potentially not matching the chunk upload route (check `[EnableRateLimiting]` attribute application)

### Server Actions — `cloud.kimball.home`

- [ ] Check production reverse proxy (nginx/Cloudflare) for rate limiting rules that may be stricter than ASP.NET config
- [ ] Verify that `upload-chunks` module rate limiter policy is actually applied to the chunk upload endpoint via `[EnableRateLimiting("module-upload-chunks")]`
- [ ] Consider exempting authenticated first-party sync traffic from rate limiting entirely, or raising limits significantly for sync endpoints
- [ ] Check production logs for `X-RateLimit-Remaining` / `Retry-After` headers to identify which limiter is being hit
- [ ] Run: `journalctl -u dotnetcloud --since "15:10 UTC" --until "15:12 UTC" | grep -i "ratelimit\|429\|RateLimit"` on the server

### Client Actions — `mint-OptiPlex-7010`

- [ ] Client-side 429 retry fix already applied (retries with backoff alongside 5xx) — wait for server resolution
