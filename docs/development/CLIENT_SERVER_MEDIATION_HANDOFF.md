# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 2026-03-21 (File browser child count fix — DEPLOYED on mint22)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:
- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**
- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the latest `main`, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document (committed to `main`).
- No moderator involvement in technical decisions, code reviews, or work coordination.

**Handoff management:**
- Put all technical findings, debugging conclusions, and next-step details in this document.
- Assistant (current agent) commits their findings/work and updates the **Active Handoff** section with actionable next steps for the other client.
- Assistant pushes commits to `main`.
- Unexpected untracked content rule (MANDATORY): remove unexpected untracked files/directories before commit; only keep intentional tracked changes for the handoff update.
- Handoff readiness gate (MANDATORY): all executable tests must pass before marking a handoff as ready.
- Environment-gated tests are allowed to be skipped, but must be explicitly identified as gated with the required environment/runtime prerequisites documented in the handoff.
- Runtime verification gate (MANDATORY): before declaring a server-side blocker fixed, verify the running service is on current binaries (not stale publish output) and document the verification command/output in handoff notes.
- OAuth contract check (MANDATORY when auth is involved): verify `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and requested scopes exactly match server-registered OpenIddict client permissions before requesting cross-machine retries.
- Secret handling rule (MANDATORY): never commit raw bearer tokens/refresh tokens; share token acquisition steps and sanitized outputs only.
- Moderator relays a short "check for updates" message to the other machine.
- Moderator handoff prompt rule (MANDATORY): every ready-to-relay message must explicitly state the target machine name (for example: `mint22`, `mint-dnc-client`, `Windows11-TestDNC`).
- Other agent pulls latest, reads the handoff, and takes action without asking questions.

**Document maintenance:**
- Pre-commit archive rule (MANDATORY): before committing this file, move all completed/older handoff tasks to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Keep only the single current task in **Active Handoff** (one active block only).
- If a task is completed, archive it first, then replace **Active Handoff** with the next task.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Current Status

- All prior Phase 2, chat, and pre-Linux sync remediation work is complete and archived.
- P0 server-side sync hardening deployed and verified on `mint22`.
- Upload hardening story: CLOSED (2026-03-15). All machines verified.
- Deletion propagation story: **CLOSED** (2026-03-16). All three machines verified.
  - Linux client (`mint-dnc-client`): verified 2026-03-16 ~03:00Z
  - Windows client (`Windows11-TestDNC`): verified 2026-03-16 ~08:16Z. Bug fixed: `RemoveFileRecordsUnderPathAsync` path separator on Windows.
  - Server (`mint22`): confirmed stable 2026-03-16. Zero ERR entries, both nodes soft-deleted, no 5xx.
- Duplicate controller fix: CLOSED (2026-03-18). Deployed and verified on `mint22`. Files endpoint returns 401, service healthy.
- Windows IIS + Service Validation: **SERVICE RUNNING** (2026-03-21). Three blockers resolved. Kestrel healthy on :5080. IIS proxy deferred P2. Archived.
- **Active cycle:** File browser child count fix — DEPLOYED on `mint22` (2026-03-21). Service running.

## Environment

| Role | Machine | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Server | `mint22` | `https://mint22:15443/` |
| Client | `Windows11-TestDNC` | Sync dir: `C:\Users\benk\Documents\synctray` |
| Client | `mint-dnc-client` | Linux Mint 22 validation host for desktop sync client implementation + E2E testing |
| Android Client | `monolith` | Android MAUI app development + emulator testing (Windows 11) |

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: OpenIddict bearer on files/sync endpoints via `FilesControllerBase` `[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = "OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore")]`.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatRealtimeService.ChannelGroup()` and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.

## Active Handoff

### File Browser Child Count Fix — DEPLOYED (on `mint22`)

**Target:** `mint22`  
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Priority:** P1

#### Summary

Folder child count bug fix deployed and service running on `mint22`. The fix ensures `ListChildrenAsync` and `ListRootAsync` return correct `childCount` values for folder nodes (previously always 0).

#### What was deployed

- `src/Modules/Files/DotNetCloud.Modules.Files.Data/Services/FileService.cs`
- Added `GetChildCountsAsync()` to batch-query child parent IDs and group counts in-memory.
- `ListChildrenAsync` and `ListRootAsync` now pass computed child counts to `ToDto(n, childCount)`.

#### Deployment Steps Completed

1. ✓ `git pull`
2. ✓ `dotnet publish` to `/opt/dotnetcloud/server`
3. ✓ Fixed file ownership: `chown -R dotnetcloud:dotnetcloud /opt/dotnetcloud/server/`
4. ✓ Fixed TLS cert permissions: `/etc/dotnetcloud/certs/dotnetcloud-selfsigned.pfx` → `root:dotnetcloud 0640`
5. ✓ `sudo systemctl restart dotnetcloud.service`
6. ✓ Service verified stable: `active (running)` for 20+ seconds, PID stable, no crash-loop

#### Root cause of TLS crash

The certificate at `/etc/dotnetcloud/certs/dotnetcloud-selfsigned.pfx` was owned by `root:root 0600`. The service runs as `dotnetcloud:dotnetcloud` — couldn't read it. OpenSSL surfaced this as a misleading `BIO routines::system lib` error rather than a clear permission denied.

**Fix:** `chown root:dotnetcloud` + `chmod 640` on the cert file.

#### Post-deploy note

After server cert change, clients may need fresh tokens (logout/login). The self-signed cert CN changed from the original, so `curl -k` or trust store update may be needed for verification.
