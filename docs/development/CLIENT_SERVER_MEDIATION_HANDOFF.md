# Client/Server Mediation Handoff

Last updated: 20260621 (Files module host Bearer auth fix — deploy required)

Purpose: shared handoff between client-side and server-side agents, mediated by user.

Archived context:

- Historical completed updates are in `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Additional history remains available in git.
- VFS Phase 3 (Windows Cloud Filter API) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (2026-05-12).
- VFS Phase 2 (core abstraction layer) completed on Windows11-TestDNC (previously).

## Process Rules

**Agent autonomy (CRITICAL):**

- Both client and server agents work autonomously — they do NOT ask the moderator for context or permission.
- Agents pull the latest `main`, read the **Active Handoff** section, and execute the work described there independently.
- All actionable items, blockers, and technical details go directly in this document (committed to `main`).
- No moderator involvement in technical decisions, code reviews, or work coordination.

**Handoff management:**

- Put all technical findings, debugging conclusions, and next-step details in this document.
- Assistant (current agent) commits their findings/work and updates the **Active Handoff** section with actionable next steps for the other client.
- Assistant pushes commits to `main`.
- Unexpected untracked content rule (MANDATORY): remove unexpected untracked files/directories before commit; only keep intentional tracked changes for the handoff update.
- Handoff readiness gate (MANDATORY): all executable tests must pass before marking a handoff as ready.
- Environment-gated tests are allowed to be skipped, but must be explicitly identified as gated with the required environment/runtime prerequisites documented in the handoff.
- Runtime verification gate (MANDATORY): before declaring a server-side blocker fixed, verify the running service is on current binaries (not stale publish output) and document the verification command/output in handoff notes.
- OAuth contract check (MANDATORY when auth is involved): verify `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and requested scopes exactly match server-registered OpenIddict client permissions before requesting cross-machine retries.
- Secret handling rule (MANDATORY): never commit raw bearer tokens/refresh tokens; share token acquisition steps and sanitized outputs only.
- Moderator relays a short "check for updates" message to the other machine.
- Moderator handoff prompt rule (MANDATORY): every ready-to-relay message must explicitly state the target machine name (for example: `mint22`, `mint-dnc-client`, `Windows11-TestDNC`).
- Other agent pulls latest, reads the handoff, and takes action without asking questions.

**Document maintenance:**

- Pre-commit archive rule (MANDATORY): before committing this file, move all completed/older handoff tasks to `CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Keep only the single current task in **Active Handoff** (one active block only).
- If a task is completed, archive it first, then replace **Active Handoff** with the next task.

## Moderator Communication (Minimal)

**Moderator relays ONLY ONE OF THESE messages — nothing more:**

- `New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull main and resume from 'Active Handoff' section.`
- `<Commit hash> — New handoff update for <target-machine>. Pull and check docs/development/CLIENT_SERVER_MEDIATION_HANDOFF.md Active Handoff.`

**No moderator task:** Moderator provides zero context, zero explanation. The handoff document has everything the receiving agent needs.

## Environment

| Role           | Machine              | Detail                                                                             |

| Client         | `mint-dnc-client`    | Linux Mint 22 validation host for desktop sync client implementation + E2E testing |
| Client         | `mint-OptiPlex-7010` | This machine — production client connected to `cloud.dotnetcloud.net`              |
| Android Client | `monolith`           | Android MAUI app development + emulator testing (Windows 11)                       |

## Key Carry-Forward Contracts

- Auth: Files module host now uses a policy scheme (`DotNetCloud.Module`) that auto-selects between `Bearer` (JWT) and `Identity.Application` (cookie) based on the `Authorization` header. Controllers use plain `[Authorize]` — no explicit scheme. All module hosts must follow this pattern.
- API envelope: middleware wraps responses; clients should unwrap via envelope helpers.
- Sync flow: changes -> tree -> reconcile -> chunk manifest -> chunk download -> file assembly.
- Desktop OAuth constant: `OAuthConstants.ClientId = "dotnetcloud-desktop"`.
- **SignalR channel group naming:** `chat-channel-{channelId}` (used by `ChatRealtimeService.ChannelGroup()` and Android `SignalRChatClient`).
- **Controller discovery:** Core.Server references Files.Host and Chat.Host via `ProjectReference`. ASP.NET Core auto-discovers controllers from referenced assemblies. Do NOT create duplicate controllers in Core.Server for routes already served by module Host assemblies.

## Active Handoff

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOY COMPLETE — Files module Bearer auth fix deployed to `cloud.dotnetcloud.net`

**Summary:**
1. ✅ `dotnet build` — 0 errors
2. ✅ `sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh` — All 3 targets succeeded
3. ⚠️ Incremental publish missed transitive JWT dependencies — manually copied `Microsoft.IdentityModel.*` + `System.IdentityModel.*` assemblies to module directory
4. ✅ Service restarted and healthy (health: 200)
5. ✅ Files module: no-auth returns 401 (expected), SSE with `Bearer test` returns 401 (was 500 — JWT handler now loads correctly)

**Next steps (on `mint-OptiPlex-7010`):**

Restart the SyncTray client to verify SSE stream connects:

```bash
cd /home/benk/Repos/DotNetCloud
dotnet run --project src/Clients/DotNetCloud.Client.SyncTray/DotNetCloud.Client.SyncTray.csproj
```

Check logs for: `"SSE stream connected."` (previously getting 401 and falling back to polling).

**Client version:** 0.3.9-alpha
**Server build:** 0.3.12

**Note:** Module host deploy script does not update transitive dependency assemblies. Future NuGet dependency additions to module hosts may require manual assembly copy to the module directory if not handled by the publish step.
